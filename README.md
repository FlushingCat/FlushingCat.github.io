# Introduction
There are many one-of-a-kind highlights in the LandMark:

- Large-scale, high-precision Reconstrution
    - For the first time, efficient training of 100 square kilometers of city-scale NeRF was realized, and the rendering resolution reached 4K with model parameters over 200 billions.
- Multiple feature extentions
    - Rich capabilities beyond reconstruction, including ajusting urban layout such as removing or adding a buildings, and ajusting appearance style such as lighting changes related to seasons.
- Training, rendering integrated system
    - City-scale NeRF system covering algorithms, operators, computing systems, which provides a solid foundation for the training, rendering and application of real-world 3D large models.

The LandMark supports multiple types of parrllel strategies. With the strategies, we achieve huge NeRF speedups and make the NeRF truly applicable to city-scale reconstruction. These parallel strategies mainly include the following types:

- [Branch Parrallel](#branch-parrallel)
- [Plane Parrallel](#plane-parrallel)
- [Channel Parrallel](#plane-parrallel)

Here we present how our parrallel methods work. Basic knowledges of NeRFs are needed for better understanding.

The scene area is divided into multiple scene blocks. Correspondingly, the model changes from having a single large grid to multiple sub-grids. with each sub-grid representing a scene block. All sub-grids share the same MLPs to decode features and ouput rgbœÉ. All the sub-grid and the shared MLPs consitiute a complete multi-branch large model. When a point sampled along the ray is fed into the multi-branch model, it is first assigned to the corresponding sub-grid based on its coordinate, and then inferred with this branch.
